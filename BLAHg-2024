It can only get so cold, 
only the heat never stops

As with the dark, and so the light.

Working and going to school leads to this unusual constraint of time. 
The time I thought I didn't have before now seemed like an abundance.

"You don't know what you got 'til it's gone..."
 
I do love to learn but it's the exchange:
        work for grades,
        work for money,
where do we make room for innovation?

A curse bestowed upon me:
        A mind full of ideas
        A life lacking resources:
                time, 
                money

Ah, so the curse has you too?

Yet, it's this constraint that pressure cooks ideas into well-done reality.
